I am **Co-founder** and **Software Architect** of [WhereIsMyTransport](https://whereismytransport.com), a technology company looking to solve problems of mobility in emerging cities. Our goal is to create a platform which changes public transport systems for the better.

I enjoy thinking about **system design** at all levels in the software stack. I also believe that **people**, **process** and the **domain** are at the heart of developing great software.

I obtained my **Bachelor of Commerce (Honours)** in Information Systems from the University of Cape Town and my **Bachelor of Science** in Computer Science from the Univerity of South Africa.
